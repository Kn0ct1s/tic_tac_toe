# Tic Tac Toe

This is a very basic version of tic tac toe that is really my    
first project with C++.

I plan on expading it quite a bit.

First i am going to make it more modular.

Then im going to add things like proper error handling as well as           
optomizing the code.

Once i am confadent, i am goint to use raylib to make it a GUI game
